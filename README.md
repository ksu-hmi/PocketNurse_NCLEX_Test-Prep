## Description

The primary purpose of this program will be to assist Nursing students’ study and prepare to take their National Certification Licensure Exam (NCLEX). This software will serve as a mobile game that will give users different categories to choose from, consisting of concepts that Registered Nurses need to be competent in to safely manage patients. Some of these concepts will include Basic Skills, Pharmacology, Patient Triage, Body Systems, Diseases/Condition Management, and Medication Calculation. Each concept will have 20 questions, divided up by difficulty level (Novice, Medium, Expert). This gives users the chance to dictate their question intensity and build confidence as they work through the concepts. I would like the software to have an aspect to where certain scores will unlock more intense levels. The layout of the exam will mimic the structure of the actual NCLEX with Multiple Choice, True/False, and Ordered Steps based questions. 

## Goal

The goal for this software is to provide nursing students an extra advantage in preparing for the NCLEX.  Not only will this software grade the user on their accuracy of right answers, but it will also show users how prepared they are for the real exam. This software will offer rationales for right and wrong answers that will continue to feed the nursing students’ growing knowledge, making them confident on exam day! Once the quiz is complete, it will show the number of correct and incorrect answers and provide a list of questions missed so the user can review and retake at their leisure.
