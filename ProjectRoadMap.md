## THIS WILL GUIDE OUR TEAM THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS 
# Development Project Roadmap 

## Sprint #1: Checkmark when completed
  - [x] Create repositories in designated area
  - [x ] Allocate sources and libaries of common projects that will be beneficial the software
  - [x ] Access Github for code repositories that will be compatible for developmental needs. These repositories will be recycled and modified to match goal: 
      - Medicine Quiz: https://github.com/Viincenttt/medicine-quiz
      - Anatomy Game: https://github.com/ksu-hmi/Anatomy-Game
      - Multiple_Choices: https://github.com/whymehin/Multiple_Choices/blob/master/multiple_choices.py
      - Fill in the Blank: https://github.com/amarch07/fill-in-blanks
      - GradeTracker.py:http://localhost:8888/edit/Documents/GitHub/pythonteachingcode/1%20gradetracker/GradeTracker.py 
      - 
  - [x ] Attempt any codes

## Sprint #2: Checkmark when completed
- [x ] Each person must make updates in the repository 
- [x ] Add commit messages
      - Each commit should include a comment that explains what you did (what your update was and what you did)
- [x ] Each person must make at least 6 code changes of significant size 
- [x ] Paste URLs to 2 code commits 

## Sprint #3: Checkmark when completed
- [] Output is clean/accurate
- [] Ensure all question answers are correct
- [] Complete Splash Page/PPT

## Findings:
    Used the Multiple Choice code from github and also the GradeTracker code and fused them together to get the code functionality that we were needing. The Multiple Choice had a section that used object oriented programming and created a class for accessing and working with two types of list, one that contained questions and another that contained the answers to the questions. This answers list would be checked against the user input. The GradeTracker code was used because of the main menu and how it utilized and referenced the functions from the main menu. The functionality that was used can easily be adapted to allow the user to indicate the levels of complexity. This option is slated for the next release.
